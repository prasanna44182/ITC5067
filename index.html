        <h1>The First Part of King Henry IV</h1>
        <h2>Act 1, Scene 1</h2>
        <h3>London. The Palace</h3>

        <p>Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</p>

        <p><b>KING HENRY IV</b></p><br>
        So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>
        Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>
        And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>
        To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
        No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
        Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>
        Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
        Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
        Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
        Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
        All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
        Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
        And furious close of civil butchery<br>
        Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br>
        March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
        Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
        The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
        No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
        As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<br>
        Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
        We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
        Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
        Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>
        To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br>
        Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>
        Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>
        For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
        But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
        And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<br>
        Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
        Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
        What yesternight our council did decree<br>
        In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>

        <p><b>WESTMORELAND</b><br>
        My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br>
        And many limits of the charge set down<br>
        But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>
        A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br>
        Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br>
        Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>
        Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<br>
        Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>
        A thousand of his people butchered;<br>
        Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<br>
        Such beastly shameless transformation,<br>
        By those Welshwomen done as may not be<br>
        Without much shame retold or spoken of.</p>

        <p><b>KING HENRY IV</b><br>
        It seems then that the tidings of this broil<br>
        Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</p>

        <p><b>WESTMORELAND</b><br>
        This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;<br>
        For more uneven and unwelcome news<br>
        Came from the north and thus it did import:<br>
        On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<br>
        Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<br>
        That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br>
        At Holmedon met,<br>
        Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br>
        As by discharge of their artillery,<br>
        And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br>
        For he that brought them, in the very heat<br>
        And pride of their contention did take horse,<br>
        Uncertain of the issue any way.</p>

        <p><b>KING HENRY IV</b><br>
        Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>
        Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>
        Stain'd with the variation of each soil<br>
        Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>
        And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>
        The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>
        Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>
        Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>
        On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>
        Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>
        To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>
        Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>
        And is not this an honourable spoil?<br>
        A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</p>

        <p><b>WESTMORELAND</b><br>
        In faith,<br>
        It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</p>

        <p><b>KING HENRY IV</b><br>
        Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<br>
        In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br>
        Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>
        A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br>
        Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>
        Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br>
        Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br>
        See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>
        Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>
        That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>
        In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>
        And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>
        Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>
        But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>
        Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br>
        Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>
        To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br>
        I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</p>

        <p><b>WESTMORELAND</b><br>
        This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,<br>
        Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br>
        Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br>
        The crest of youth against your dignity.</p>

        <p><b>KING HENRY IV</b><br>
        But I have sent for him to answer this;<br>
        And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br>
        Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br>
        Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<br>
        Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br>
        But come yourself with speed to us again;<br>
        For more is to be said and to be done<br>
        Than out of anger can be uttered.</p>

        <p><b>WESTMORELAND</b><br>
        I will, my liege.</p>

        <p>I have used a {html} tag which is the main code to write any html page. I have used {head} tag to mention my header part of the page and then inside the header i had used {body} tag to write the body of my html page. I had used {article} tag to make it perfect to look like an article inside which i had used {h1}, {h2} and {h3} for headings and the {p} for paragraphs. Whenever I need to make the headings bold, I had used {b} tag to make it bold and then as the article has many small lines in each poem i had used {br} tag to break the lines and then i have used {a} tag and to refere that {h ref} to add the link of the source of my work. I had used {footer} tag to make footer to my webpage. I have used {span} tag to give identifiers to the script we are writing below. I have used {script} tag to embed javascript in the html document.</p>
